# Question 3 (Diffculty Level **)

Implement a function called `mask_out` in [q3.py](../questions/q3.py).

- The mask_out function takes in three parameter:
  - `sentence` [type: `str`]
  - `banned` [type: `str`]
  - `substitutes` [type: `str`]

- This function **returns a string** that is a copy of `sentence`, except that if a character in `sentence` is found in `banned`, this character will be replaced with a corresponding character in `substitutes` whose index in `substitutes` is the same as the index of the banned character in the parameter `banned`.

  For example, if `banned` is '**abc**' and `substitutes` is '**xyz**', then every '**a**' in sentence is replaced with '**x**', every '**b**' is replaced with '**y**', and every '**c**' is replaced with '**z**'.

- You can assume the following:
  - `banned` contains unique characters, i.e., there are no duplicated characters in `banned`.
  - `substitutes` contains at least one character.
  - `banned` is either of the same length as `substitutes` or longer than `substitutes`. When `banned` is longer than `substitutes`, the additional characters in `banned` will be replaced with the first character in `substitutes`. For example, if `banned` is '**abcde**' and substitutes is '**xy**', then '**c**', '**d**' and '**e**' will be replaced by '**x**'.

## Examples

### Example 1

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print(mask_out('pineapple', 'e', '#')) 
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
pin#appl#
```

### Example 1

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print(mask_out('pineapple', 'e', '#'))
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
pin#appl#
```

### Example 2

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print(mask_out('pineapple', 'aeiou', '#$%^&'))
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
p%n$#ppl$
```

### Example 3

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print(mask_out('pineapple', 'aeiou', '#$'))
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
p#n$#ppl$
```
