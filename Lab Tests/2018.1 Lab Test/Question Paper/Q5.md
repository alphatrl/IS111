# Question 5 (Diffculty Level ***)

Implement a function called `expand` in [q5.py](../Original/q5.py).

- The `expand` function takes in a parameter called `text` (type: `str`).

- The string `text` always consists of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, spaces, and segments of the form "**&start-end**", where **start** and **end** are non-negative integers, and **end** is always greater than or equal to start. We call these segments ***index references***.
  
  For example, `text` could be '**`abCD &1-3xyz&2-15`**', which has two ***index references***, namely, '**`&1-3`**' and '**`&2-15`**'.

- The function expands `text` by replacing those ***index references*** with characters from other parts of `text`, using the index numbers in the ***index references***.

- To perform the expansion, you need to do the following:

  - Assign index numbers starting from 0 to all characters in text excluding the index references. For example, if text is '**`ABC &5-7 XYZ`**', then the assigned index numbers should be as follows:

  |Assigned Index Number| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |   |   |   |   | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
  |:-------------------:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
  |Character in text:| A | B | C |  | & | 5 | - | 7 |  | X | Y | Z |

  - To perform the expansion, look for all ***index references*** in `text`. For each ***index reference***, replace it with the characters between the corresponding **start** index and **end** index.

  - In the example above, '**`&5-7`**' is replaced with '**`XYZ`**'. Therefore, '**`ABC &5-7 XYZ`**' is expanded to '**`ABC XYZ XYZ`**'.

  - If any value between **start** and **end** (inclusive of **start** and **end**) is an invalid index, a '**?**' is used to represent the character at that invalid index. For example, if text is '**`ABC &6-9 XYZ`**', then the expanded string will be '**`ABC YZ?? XYZ`**' (because index numbers 8 and 9 are invalid).

## Examples

### Example 1

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print(expand('ABC &5-7 XYZ'))
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
ABC XYZ XYZ
```

### Example 2

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print(expand('&0-3&4-5ABC XYZ'))
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
ABC XYABC XYZ
```

### Example 3

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print(expand('&2-5ABC'))
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
C???ABC
```
