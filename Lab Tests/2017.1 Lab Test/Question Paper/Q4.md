# Question 4 (Diffculty Level ***)

Implement the `find_tags` function in [q4.py](../Original/q4.py).

This function takes one parameter:

- `sentence`: `string` type

This function will return a string that contains all the substrings enclosed within square brackets in `sentence` , i.e., between '**[**' and '**]**'. Each substring is prefixed by a sequence number followed by the '**-'** symbol. (See examples below.)

You can assume that inside `sentence` the square brackets are always properly paired, i.e., there would not be any missing '**[**' or missing '**]**'. You can also assume that there are no nested square brackets, i.e., you would not encounter cases such as "**[A[BC]]DEF**".

## Examples

### Example 1

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print(find_tags('Coding[Rocks]'))
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
1-Rocks
```

**Note:**

- '**1-**' is prefixed before '**Rocks**' because it is the 1st substring enclosed within square brackets encountered.

### Example 2

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print(find_tags('[apple]and[orange]and[apple]again!'))
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
1-apple,2-orange,3-apple
```

**Note:**

- '**1-**' is prefixed before '**apple**' because it is the 1st substring enclosed within square brackets encountered.

- '**2-**' is prefixed before '**irange**' because it is the 1st substring enclosed within square brackets encountered.

- '**3-**' is prefixed before '**apple**' because it is the 1st substring enclosed within square brackets encountered.

### Example 3

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print(find_tags('IAmTaking[mrt]To[SMU]ButThe[nel]IsDelayedAgain.'))
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
1-mrt,2-SMU,3-nel
```

### Example 4

The function should also handle empty strings and strings that do not contain any square brackets as shown below:

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print('>' + find_tags('') + '<')
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
><
```

### Example 5

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print('>' + find_tags('apple') + '<')
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
><
```
