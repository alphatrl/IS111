# Question 3

Grab current offers 3 types of monthly subscription plans:

|Commute Plans ($19/month)| Food Plan ($9.99/month) | All access plans ($25/month) |
|-------------------------|------------------------|------|
|<ul><li>$4 off 10 rides</li></ul>|<ul><li>No delivery fee on 50 GrabFood orders (minimum order of $10)</li><li>$5 off GrabFood voucher (minimum order of $10)</li><li>$10 off GrabFood voucher (minimum order of $20)</li></ul>|<ul><li>$4 off 10 rides</li><li>No delivery fee on 50 GrabFood orders (minimum order of $10)</li></ul>|

## Part A (Difficulty Level: *)

_Assume that the average cost of a Grab ride is $10._

In [q3a.py](../Original/q3a.py), implement a function called `calculate_fees_1()`. The function takes in the following parameter:

- `n` (type: `int`): This is a non-negative integer that represents the number of Grab ride in a month.

The function returns the least amount of money that you expect to pay for the `n` Grab rides that you plan to take that month.

**Hint**: Since you are planning to take Grab rides only you may consider subscribing to a _Commute plan_ only, or not subscribe to a _Commute Plan_. You may not subscibe to more than 1 plan at any one time.

E.g., 

- `calculate_fees_1(3)` returns 30
  - with a Commute subscription plan, you pay $19 + 3x($10-$4) : $37 (each of the 3 rides costs only $6 because the Commute plan provides $4 off 10 rides
  - without a Commute subscription plan, you pay 3x$10 = $30.

- `calculate_fees_1(5)` returns 49
  - with a Commute subscription plan, you pay $19 + 5x($10-$4) = $49 (each of the 5 rides costs only $6 because the Commute plan provides $4 off 10 rides),
  - without a Commute subscription plan, you pay 5x$10 = $50.

- `calculate_fees_1(12)` returns 99
  - with a Commute subscription plan you pay $19 + 10x($10-$4) + 2x$10 = $99 (each of the first 10 rides costs only $6 because the Commute plan provides $4 off 10 rides
  - without a Commute subscription plan, you pay 12x$10 = $120.

## Part B (Difficuly Level: **)

Assume now that the:

- average cost of a Grab ride is $10
- average cost of a GrabFood order (excluding delivery fee) is $20
- delivery fee for every GrabFood order is $5

in [q3b.py](../Original/q3b.py) write another function called `calculate_fees_2(n,m)` that takes in two parameters:

- `n` (type: int): This is a non-negative integer that represents the number of Grab rides that you plan to take in a month,

- `m` (type: int): This is a non-negative integer that represents the number of GrabFood orders that you plan to make in a month.

The function returns that you the least amount of money that you will expect to pay for the Grab rides and GrabFood orders that you have taken that month.

(**Hint**: You may choose to subscribe to a Commute Plan __or__ a Food Plan __or__ an All Access Plan, __or__ not subscribe to any plans. You may not subscribe to more than 1 plan at any one time.)

For example,

- `calculate_fees_2(10,12)` returns 325 because
  - without any plans, you pay 10x$10 + 12x$20 + 12x$5 = $400
  - with a Commute plan, you pay $19 + 10x$6 + 12x$20 + 12x$5 = $379
  - with a Food plan, you pay 10x$10 + $9.99 + 12x$20 - $10 - $5 = $334.99
  - with an All Access plan, you pay $25 + 10x$6 + 12x$20 - $325

- `calculate_fees_2(12,57)` returns 1280 because
  - without any plans, you pay 12x$10 + 57x$20 + 57x$5 = $1545
  - with a Commute plan, you pay $19 + 10x$6 + 2x$10 + 57x$20 + 57x$5 = $1524
  - with a Food plan, you 12x$10 + $9.99 + 57x$20 + 7x$5 - $10 - $5 = $1289.99
  - with an All Access plan, you pay $25 + 10x$6 + 2x$10 + 57x$20 + 7x$5 = $1280

- `calculate_fees_2(3,1)` returns 49.99 because
  - without any plans, you will have to pay 3x$10 + 1x$20 + 1x$5 = $55
  - with a Commute plan, you will have to pay $19 + 3x$6 + 1x$20 + 1x$5 = $62
  - with a Food plan, you will have to pay 3x$10 + $9.99 + 1x$20 - $10 = $49.99
  - with an All Access plan, you will have to pay $25 + 3x$6 + 1x$20 = $63
