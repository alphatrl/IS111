# Question 3 (Diffculty Level **)

Implement a function called `get_total_transactions_in_month` in [q3.py](../Original/q3.py).

- This function takes two parameter:
  - `trans_file` (type: `str`): This is the name of a file containing transaction data. The format of the file will be explained below.
  - `month` (type: `str`): This is a string representing a particular month of a particular year in `'mm/yyyy'` or `'m/yyyy'`

    Example:
    - `'10/2017'` represents October 2017
    - `'4/2015'` and `'04/2015'` represents April 2015

    (Note that the year is always represented in 4 digits. The month is represented with either 1 digit or 2 digit)

  The `trans_file` contains transaction data. Each transaction is in one row with three columns **separated by tabs**. The first column is the date of the transaction in `'mm/dd/yyyy'` format (where month and day can be either 1 digit or 2 digits). The second column is the transaction amount. The last column is a description of the transaction.

  An example of a `trans_file` looks like the following:

  |  `trans_file` contents   |
  |----------|
  |10/3/2015  $34.50  phone bill|
  |4/15/2015  $20.00  EZ-link card|
  |12/03/2016 $80.50  birthday gift|
  |9/30/2016  $15.20  meal|
  |04/01/2015 $300.00 holiday air ticket|

- This function returns a the total transaction amount (as a `float`) during the month and year as indicated by the parameter `month`

## Examples

Suppose the file `my_transactions.txt` looks like the file shown above

### E.g. 1

```python
get_total_transactions_in_month('my_transactions.txt', '04/2015')
```

returns `320`.

(Because there are two transactions during the month of '04/2015' in  the file, adding up to $320.00)

### E.g. 2

```python
get_total_transactions_in_month('my_transactions.txt', '9/2016')
```

returns `15.2`

### E.g. 3

```python
get_total_transactions_in_month('my_transactions.txt', '01/2017')
```

returns `0.0`

### E.g. 4

```python
get_prices_in_range([], 0.0, 100.0)
```

returns `[]`
