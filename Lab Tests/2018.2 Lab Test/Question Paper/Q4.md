# Question 4 (Diffculty Level ***)

Implement a function called `find_stations_within_distance` in [q4.py](../Original/q4.py).

- This function takes in the following parameters:
  - `mrt_map` (type: `list`): This is a list in which each element is a list of strings representing names of MRT stations in the same line. For example, given the following MRT map, its corresponding list representation is given below.

  ```python
  [ ['Botanic Gardens', 'Stevens', 'Newton', 'Little India', 'Rochor'],
  ['Newton', 'Novena', 'Toa Payoh', 'Braddell', 'Bishan'],
  ['Dhoby Ghaut', 'Little India', 'Farrer Park', 'Boon Keng'] ]
  ```

  - `orig` (type: `str`): This is the name of an MRT station, representing the origin of a trip.

  - `dist` (type: `int`): This is a positive integer representing a distance (in terms of number of stops).

The function **returns a list** that contains all the stations that can be reached from the station `orig` within `dist` stops, i.e., these stations are `no more than` `dist` stops away from `orig`. The order of the stations in the returned list doesnâ€™t matter. Test your code using [q4_test.py](../Original/q4_test.py).

## Examples

Suppose `mrt_map` is equal to the list shown above (i.e., corresponds to the map above):

### E.g. 1

```python
find_stations_within_distance(mrt_map, 'Botanic Gardens', 2)
```

returns `['Stevens', 'Newton']` or `['Newton', 'Stevens']`.

(Because there are two transactions during the month of '04/2015' in  the file, adding up to $320.00)

### E.g. 2

```python
find_stations_within_distance(mrt_map, 'Little India', 1)
```

returns `['Farrer Park', 'Newton', 'Rochor', 'Dhoby Ghaut']` or a list of these 4 stations in a different order

### E.g. 3

```python
find_stations_within_distance(mrt_map, 'Dhoby Ghaut', 3)
```

returns `['Little India', 'Farrer Park', 'Boon Keng', 'Rochor',
'Newton', 'Stevens', 'Novena']` or a list of these 7 stations in a different order.

Note: The destination stations `'Rochor'`, `'Newton'`, `'Stevens'`, `'Novena'` are on a different line than `'Dhoby Ghaut'`
