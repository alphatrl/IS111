# Question 2 (Diffculty Level **)

Implement a function called `represent_numbers` in [q2.py](../Original/q2.py).

- This function takes two parameters: `start` and `end`. You can assume that both parameters are integers.
- The function **returns a string** that represents all the integers between `start` (inclusive) and `end` (inclusive) in the following way:
  - Each integer *n* is represented by *m* **dashes** ('-') where *m* is the absolute value of *n* (i.e., |*n*|).In other words, if *n* is positive or 0, *m* is the same as *n*. If *n* is negative, *m* is *-n*.

    For example,
    - **3** is represented as '---'.
    - **-5** is represented as '-----'.
    - **0** is represented as '' (empty string).
  - There is a **hash key** ('**#**') between the representations of two integers.
- If `end` is smaller than `start`, the function returns an empty string.

## Examples

### E.g. 1

If the function is invoked like this:
  
```python
print(represent_numbers(1, 5))
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
-#--#---#----#-----
```

### E.g. 2

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print(represent_numbers(3, 5))
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
---#----#-----
```

### E.g. 3

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print(represent_numbers(-3, 1))
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
---#--#-##-
```

**Note:** -3, -2 and -1 are represented as ---, -- and -, respectively.

### E.g. 4

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print(represent_numbers(1, 1))
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
-
```

### E.g. 5

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print('[' + represent_numbers(3, 1) + ']')
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
[]
```

Note: '**[**' and '**]**' are part of the print statement above
