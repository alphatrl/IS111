# Question 6 (Diffculty Level ***)

Implement a function called `print_snake` in [q6.py](../Original/q6.py).

- This function takes two parameters:
  
  - `sequence` (type: `str`): This is an input string. You can assume that it is not empty and it doesn’t contain any space.
  
  - `w` (type: `int`): This is the width of the output. You can assume that `w` is at least 2.

- The function prints out the characters in **sequence** in `w` columns, in the shape of a snake, as illustrated by the examples below.

  Note that
  - the “tail” of the snake is always at the ***bottom right corner*** of the output, and

  - each vertical segment of the snake has a height of 3.

## Examples

### Example 1

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print_snake('abcdefghijkl', 4)
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
  ab      // The height of each
   c      // vertical segment is
gfed      // 3
h                 // The tail of the snake is always
ijkl              // at the bottom right corner.
```

### Example 2

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print_snake('abcdefghijkl', 3)
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
a
bcd
  e
hgf
i
jkl
```

### Example 3

If the function is invoked like this:

```python
print_snake('abcdefghijkl', 5)
```

the statement generates the following output:

```code
    a
fedcb
g
hijkl
```
